  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p>
    I am a passionate and self-motivated educator, researcher, and designer.
    I have a well rounded software and mechanical engineering experience.
    My software engineering experience include working within GNU/Linux to
    create multiple projects that utilize Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JS, and Git.
    My favourite personal projects are available on my Github.
    Moreover, I am currently working as a tool design engineer and
    I have been employing the illogic functionality (a VB.NET tool) of Autodesk Inventor to create
    and modify templates for standard/custom products. Additionally, I have working experience with
    using Postgresql via GNU/Linux command line and pgAdmin 4.
